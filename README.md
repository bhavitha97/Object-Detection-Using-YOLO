# Object-Detection-Using-YOLO
Took eight different one-minute videos and detected the objects in every video using the YOLO algorithm.
We have written the Python code in MATLAB to detect the objects, and how many times the objects are displayed. 
In MATLAB, we converted those videos into frames using Python code.
