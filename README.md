# Object-Detection-Using-YOLO
Captured eight different one-minute random videos.
● Designed a Python code in MATLAB to detect objects like people, trees, cars, roads, rivers, etc., in each
video and filtered videos based on object labels using the YOLO algorithm.
● Read videos from the directory, extracted frames, performed object detection on each frame, and kept
track of the detected object labels.
● Printed the list of video URLs where the specified object label is detected.
